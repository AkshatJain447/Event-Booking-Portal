## 💡 Project Motivation

Eventease was built as a part of my hands-on learning journey during a full-stack web development training program. While the course helped me gain foundational understanding of the MERN stack, I wanted to go beyond theoretical concepts and apply what I learned to a real-world project.

Instead of following a pre-built tutorial, I conceptualized and developed Eventease from the ground up — designing the architecture, implementing both frontend and backend logic, handling authentication, building dashboards, and ensuring responsive design. This project reflects my ability to convert technical knowledge into a functional product with clean UI, modular code, and a good user experience.
