## 💡 Project Motivation

Eventease began as a self-learning challenge. I initially enrolled in a paid training program to learn full-stack development, but it turned out to be fraudulent. Determined to grow regardless, I independently studied the MERN stack, and Eventease became my proof-of-work.

This project reflects not just my technical capabilities, but also my resilience and ability to learn complex technologies on my own. Every line of code was written, debugged, and refined from scratch — from backend API design to responsive frontend animations.
